## Welcome to the GitHub account of Woodwell's Risk team

Woodwell provides selected communities with assessments of climate change-influenced risk to allow for near- and long-term resilience planning. The key deliverable of this effort is a report detailing present and future climate-driven risk for a range of hazards selected by community representativesâ€”complete with relevant maps and figures, and supplemented by a detailed technical and methodological appendix upon request. If desired, Woodwell can also present the research findings in a briefing to stakeholders selected by each community.

Within the repositories in this organization, you will find the code and methods behind our suite of climate risk assessment tools.
