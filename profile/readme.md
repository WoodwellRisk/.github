## Woodwell Climate Research Center: Risk

Woodwell provides selected communities with assessments of climate change-influenced risk to allow for near- and long-term resilience planning. The key deliverable of this effort is a report detailing present and future climate-driven risk for a range of hazards selected by community representativesâ€”complete with relevant maps and figures, and supplemented by a detailed technical and methodological appendix upon request. If desired, Woodwell can also present the research findings in a briefing to stakeholders selected by each community.

Within the repositories in this organization, you will find the code and methods behind our suite of climate risk assessment tools. Our open source data products are organized into climatic perils:

| Theme | Overview  |
|---|---|
|  [Extreme Heat](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AWoodwellRisk%20topic%3Aheat&type=repositories) | Calculating heat extremes and their impacts on public health. | 
|  [Coastal Risk](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AWoodwellRisk%20topic%3Acoastal&type=repositories) | Assessing the impacts of storm surge and high winds for coastal communities.  |
|  Agriculture | Projecting crop yields under future climatic conditions. | 
|  Flood Assessment | High resolution flood extents due to extreme rainfall. | 
|  Drought & Water Scarcity | Understanding the future of global water availability. | 
|  River & Lake Ice |  | 

We also provide useful tools for derived climate analyses:
