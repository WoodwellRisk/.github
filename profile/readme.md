## Welcome to the Github Organization for Woodwell Risk

Woodwell provides selected communities with assessments of climate change-influenced risk to allow for near- and long-term resilience planning. The key deliverable of this effort is a report detailing present and future climate-driven risk for a range of hazards selected by community representativesâ€”complete with relevant maps and figures, and supplemented by a detailed technical and methodological appendix upon request. If desired, Woodwell can also present the research findings in a briefing to stakeholders selected by each community.

We believe that the analyses we provide and the data that drives them should be accessible to all. In the repositories herein, we share the code that we use in our community analyses. In addition, please see our [methodology website](https://woodwellrisk.github.io/) and [data viewer]().
